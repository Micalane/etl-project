What if we pretend we work for a large pizza chain that is deciding where to expand next? 
We’re given data on the cost of living in each city: https://www.kaggle.com/debdutta/cost-of-living-index-by-country  
and the data on existing pizza restaurants in cities across the US: https://www.kaggle.com/datafiniti/pizza-restaurants-and-the-pizza-they-sell

Step one: explore the data 

Step two: decide how it needs to be “transformed” to be useful in analysis. 

Step three: create a diagram of the data

Step four: extract it

Step five: transform it

Step six: load the final database

Step seven: write the technical report

##Definitions Provided by Numbeo:

Cost of living indices are relative to New York City (NYC) which means that for New York City, each index should be 100. If another city has, for example, rent index of 120, it means that on an average in that city rents are 20% more expensive than in New York City. If a city has rent index of 70, that means on an average in that city rents are 30% less expensive than in New York City.

Cost of Living Index (Excl. Rent) is a relative indicator of consumer goods prices, including groceries, restaurants, transportation and utilities. Cost of Living Index doesn't include accommodation expenses such as rent or mortgage. If a city has a Cost of Living Index of 120, it means Numbeo estimates it is 20% more expensive than New York (excluding rent).

Rent Index is an estimation of prices of renting apartments in the city compared to New York City. If Rent index is 80, Numbeo estimates that price of rents in that city is on an average 20% less than the price in New York.

Groceries Index is an estimation of grocery prices in the city compared to New York City. To calculate this section, Numbeo uses weights of items in the "Markets" section for each city.

Restaurants Index is a comparison of prices of meals and drinks in restaurants and bars compared to NYC.
Cost of Living Plus Rent Index is an estimation of consumer goods prices including rent comparing to New York City.

Local Purchasing Power shows relative purchasing power in buying goods and services in a given city for the average wage in that city. If domestic purchasing power is 40, this means that the inhabitants of that city with the average salary can afford to buy on an average 60% less goods and services than New York City residents with an average salary.
