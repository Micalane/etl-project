What if we pretend we work for a large pizza chain that is deciding where to expand next? 
We’re given data on the cost of living in each city: https://www.kaggle.com/debdutta/cost-of-living-index-by-country  
and the data on existing pizza restaurants in cities across the US: https://www.kaggle.com/datafiniti/pizza-restaurants-and-the-pizza-they-sell

Step one: explore the data 

Step two: decide how it needs to be “transformed” to be useful in analysis. 

Step three: create a diagram of the data

Step four: extract it

Step five: transform it

Step six: load the final database

Step seven: write the technical report
